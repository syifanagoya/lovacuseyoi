How much does he make per movie?</p><p><strong>Keanu Reeves’ salary has varied greatly throughout his career. He was paid $95,000 for his role in “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure”, compared to the $250 million he reportedly made from the two “Matrix” sequels. Much of his wealth has come from box office profit-sharing.</strong></p><p>For more on Keanu Reeves’ career in movies and how much money he has made, read on.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Bill & Ted</h2><p>For many viewers, their first exposure to Keanu Reeves was in 1989’s “Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure”, where he played Theodore “Ted” Logan.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>The film became a cult comedy classic</a>, spawning a sequel, “Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey” a couple of years later, as well as a second sequel, “Bill & Ted Face the Music” more than thirty years later.</p><p>As one of his first roles, Reeves’ portrayal of Ted did not net him the millions he would enjoy later in his career. <a href=# rel=noopener>He was paid a reported $95,000 dollars for the role</a>, an impressive amount for a young actor but one he would later greatly surpass.</p><p>Money clearly isn’t the primary motivator for Reeves, who famously (and probably wisely) turned down a role in 1997’s “Speed 2: Cruise Control”, <a href=# rel=noopener>leaving a reported $12 million on the table in the process.</a></p><p>While Reeves is a professional actor, he is evidently not a greedy one.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The Matrix</h2><p>After a relatively mixed spell in the mid-1990s, Reeves starred alongside Al Pacino in the well-received “The Devil’s Advocate” in 1997. <a href=# rel=noopener>He reportedly agreed to have his salary reduced by a few million dollars so the producers could afford to hire Al Pacino</a>.</p><p>The film was the <a href=# class=rank-math-link>beginning of his most successful period</a> financially and “The Matrix” would take his career to new heights. He was paid $10 million upfront for the first film in the trilogy but this eventually rose to $35 million from profit-sharing when it turned out to be a smash hit.</p><p>The huge success of “The Matrix” meant that Warner Bros soon greenlit a pair of sequels, to be made simultaneously and released half a year apart in 2003. It’s unclear exactly how much Reeves was paid for the sequels, though it’s believed he was being paid about $15 million per movie at the time.</p><p>In any case, the “Matrix” sequels were even greater successes, with <a href=# rel=noopener>“The Matrix Reloaded” in particular becoming the highest-grossing R-rated movie for 13 years until it was eventually overtaken by “Deadpool”</a>. As Keanu retained a sizable profit-sharing deal in his contract, <a href=# rel=noopener>it’s believed that he was paid as much as $250 million for starring in the two sequels</a>.</p><p>According to the Wall Street Journal, however, Reeves decided to donate much of his profit-sharing money to the films’ production. <a href=# rel=noopener>It’s alleged that he gave away tens of millions to the special-effects and costume-design teams</a>, saying that they deserved to be properly funded for their hard work on making the movies.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>John Wick</h2><p>Reeves’ next big series would debut a decade later with the premiere of “John Wick” in 2014. The film, which had a modest $20 million budget, saw <a href=# class=rank-math-link>Reeves reportedly</a> paid less than $2 million.</p><p>His reduction in salary was not unique to him; the majority of major film projects no longer pay their stars significant salaries upfront and prefer to backload their contracts with box office incentives. <a href=# rel=noopener>“John Wick” made $80 million globally, meaning Reeves likely made a good deal more than his initial payment</a>.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>While he received a higher salary for the sequels, about $2.5 million for “John Wick: Chapter 2”</a>, the film’s much larger $171 million worldwide gross means he probably made significantly more than he did for the original movie.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo63NrK6eqqNjsLC5jqGmsGWdqrCpecOonKxlm5qur8GMq5yerpWoeq6typ5kqZ2iYrqwwsieZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./ashton-kutcher-reveals-demi-moore-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ashton Kutcher reveals how he moved on from Demi Moore divorce">&larr;
