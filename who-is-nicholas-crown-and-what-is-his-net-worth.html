And it is this newfound social media celebrity status that has put him firmly in the public’s consciousness. Inevitably, as with most celebrities, his fans and the general public would want to know more about him.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Nicholas Crown’s Biography</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full Name:</strong> Nicholas DiNorscio</li><li><strong>Nickname:</strong> Nicholas Crown</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Male</li><li><strong>Date of Birth:</strong> September 30, 1985</li><li><strong>Nicholas Crown’s Age:</strong> 38 years old</li><li><strong>Place of Birth:</strong> Livingston, New Jersey, United States of America</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Mixed</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Libra</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christianity</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li><li><strong>Nicholas Crown’s Parents:</strong> Larry DiNorscio (Father) and Deborah McCoy (Mother)</li><li><strong>Siblings:</strong> Michael DiNorscio (Brother)</li><li><strong>Nicholas Crown’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 11 inches</li><li><strong>Nicholas Crown’s Height in Centimeters:</strong> 180cm</li><li><strong>Education:</strong> Seton Hall Preparatory School, Cornell University</li><li><strong>Profession:</strong> Entrepreneur and Social media personality</li><li><strong>Nicholas Crown’s Net Worth:</strong> Est. $10 million</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being a well known TikToker</li><li><strong>Nicholas Crown’s Instagram:</strong> @nicholascrown (Nicholas Crown)</li><li><strong>Twitter:</strong> Nicholas Crown (@nicholascrown)</li><li><strong>YouTube:</strong> Nicholas Crown</li><li><strong>TikTok:</strong> nicholas_crown</li></ul><h2><strong>Nicholas Crown Was Born In The Mid 1980s</strong></h2><p>Nicholas Crown was born Nicholas DiNorscio on September 30, 1985, in Livingston, New Jersey, United States of America, and his birth status makes him an American citizen. He is the first son of Larry DiNorscio and Deborah McCoy, and he has a younger brother named Michael DiNorscio.</p><p>Nicholas spent most of his early life in New Jersey while living in towns like Mendham, Morristown, and later in the upper east side of New York City. As a child, Nicholas experienced one of the worst things that could ever happen to any young child when he bore witness to his family’s breakup, which was brought on by his parent’s divorce when he was only 7 years old.</p><p>It was a truly traumatic experience, but the young Nicholas used his love for music as an outlet to let out the frustrations at hand he had been dealt by life. He developed a passion for delta blues music, and his skill on the guitar was showcased in a good number of student-run music concerts and music competitions while in school.</p><p>Nicholas Crown attended Cornell University and graduated cum laude with a degree in Applied Economics and Management in 2008. Before University enrollment and subsequent graduation, Nicholas had bagged a high school diploma from Seton Hall Preparatory School.</p><h3><strong>Nicholas Crown Is The Creator of The “Rich Vs. Really Rich” Content On TikTok</strong></h3><p>Nicholas Crown is currently stamping his seal of success on various social media platforms, particularly on <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>TikTok</a>, where his “Rich vs. Really Rich” content is currently taking the social media family by storm. He now has more than 1.7 million followers and over 82.7 million likes.</p><h2><strong>Nicholas Crown’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Nicholas Crown is reported to be currently worth an estimated $10 million. This includes income from his various companies and his other career as a social media influencer. His success on social media platforms has allowed him to represent several brands that pay for his services in return. Crown reportedly earns a whopping $1 million annually from his diverse business interests.</p><h3><strong>Nicholas Crown’s Net Worth Comes From Being A Successful Entrepreneur</strong></h3><p>In 2021, Nicholas Crown set up what is currently his second company known as Amoeba, a company that, at its most basic, was designed to employ the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to assist people in the digital marketing sector. In 2022, he entered into a partnership with Public.com, a FinTech start-up, and Honey, a savings conglomerate that PayPal acquired for $4 billion in 2019.</p><p>However, it’s essential to recognize that Crown’s journey to financial success through entrepreneurship began several years ago. He started by working as a pit clerk for New York Mercantile Exchange in 2005, which by every account, happened while he was still a Uni undergrad. He had the unique privilege to learn at the feet of a true master in the person of popular oil trader Mark Fisher.</p><p>The next phase of his impressive career was accomplished as an analyst with Barclays Capital’s repo trading desk. He began his journey at the company at their offices in London, UK, before his relocation to its New York offices.</p><p>His valuable experience garnered over time in the trading sector prompted UBS to hire him in 2011 to start and subsequently run their Greenfield basis trading desk, first in Stamford, Connecticut, and later in New York City. He used his well-honed abilities to create a fiber-optic spread while using UBS’s much-outdated trading platform. It was a move that not many saw coming and were impressed by.</p><p>This favorable impression attracted many heavyweights in the hedge fund business who were all too happy to hand over the management of their substantial trade platforms to Nicholas Crown. Millennium and Citadel are just 2 of the big dogs that Crown had the privilege and expertise of managing.</p><p>With all the spotlight on his trading platform, it was somewhat of a surprise when Nicholas opted to leave Wall Street just around 2013. He decided to do some traveling, and while he was there, he started getting an idea to begin his own company. The company was eventually birthed in 2013 and has since become Resume Atelier.</p><p>In a nutshell, Resume Atelier uses ATS and AI to help job-seeking candidates improve their chances of getting hired while also aiding Human Resource personnel/companies in selecting the best candidates for the posts they might be looking to fill.</p><h3><strong>Nicholas Crown Also Started A Music Band</strong></h3><p>Nicholas Crown shocked the world when he decided to abandon the world of finance in favor of pursuing his passion for music. He fulfilled this longing for music by creating a blues-rock music group called The Cold Water Electric, and together, they toured many states in the US, including Louisiana and Texas.</p><p>It would also seem that Nicholas Crown doesn’t do anything just for the sake of it and always finds a way to make it successful. This statement is backed up by the fact that his band was voted the best new band in 2016.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZMSpu4yiqmammZi1sLjArGScqp%2Bsu26tzZ1ksKCRqXqqv4yhoKxlnprBbsPOq6uhZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./does-comedian-babatunde-aleshe-have-a-wife-here-is-what-we-know-about-his-personal-life-2.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does Comedian Babatunde Aleshe Have A Wife?
