His mother, a pupil of <strong>Karol Mikuli</strong>, was his first teacher.</p><p>This early start laid the groundwork for what would become a prolific career in music.</p><h3><span id=Education-and-Influences>Education and Influences</span></h3><p>Askenase studied under <strong>Emil von Sauer</strong>, a direct pupil of <strong>Franz Liszt</strong>, at the <strong>Vienna Academy of Music</strong>.
