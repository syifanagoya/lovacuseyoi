This article covers all you need to know about Michael Portillo’s wife.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Carolyn Eadie’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Carolyn Claire Eadie-Portillo</li><li><strong>Gender:</strong> Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth:</strong> March 15, 1952</li><li><strong>Carolyn Eadie’s Age: </strong>71 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Caucasian</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> British</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Pisces</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation: </strong>Straight</li><li><strong>Religion:</strong> Christian</li><li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married</li><li><strong>Carolyn Eadie’s Husband:</strong> Michael Portillo</li><li><strong>Carolyn Eadie’s Height in Inches:</strong> 5 feet 5 inches</li><li><strong>Carolyn Eadie’s Height in Centimeters:</strong> 165 cm</li><li><strong>Carolyn Eadie’s Weight:</strong> 55kg</li><li><strong>Carolyn Eadie’s Net Worth: </strong>£500,000</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> Being the wife of the former Chief Secretary to the Treasury of the United Kingdom, Michael Portillo</li></ul><h2><strong>Carolyn Eadie is 71 Years Old</strong></h2><p>Carolyn Claire Eadie was born on March 15, 1952, in North London where she was also raised. Several details about her background have remained unknown as the celebrity wife has not disclosed information about her family such as her parents’ name, occupation, and religion, among others.</p><p>In the same vein, it is not known if Carolyn is an only child of her parents or has siblings with whom she grew up as she has not said anything about her childhood. One thing is sure though, she is a Brit and belongs to the white ethnicity with her zodiac personality being Pisces.</p><p>When it comes to her education, there is no available detail of the schools she attended and the level of education she attained, and also the degree and certificates she obtained. Although going by her career achievements it is obvious Carolyn Eadie is well educated.</p><h2><strong>Carolyn Eadie’s Husband, Michael Portillo, is a Journalist And Former Politician</strong></h2><p>Born on the 26th of May 1953 in Bushey, Hertfordshire, England, Carolyn Eadie’s husband, Michael Portillo is primarily a journalist and TV broadcaster. Born in Britain, the 70-year-old is a British citizen and his father, Luis Gabriel Portillo, was a refugee.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/michael-portillo.jpg alt="Carolyn Eadie" width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Portillo studied at Harrow County Grammar School and Peterhouse. One of his famous works is a BBC documentary series entitled Great Railway Journeys, wherein he documents his travels to various places across the globe. This series spawned other documentaries such as Great British Railway Journeys, Great American Railroad Journeys, and Great Indian Railway Journeys.</p><p>Portillo bagged a first-class degree in history in 1975 and subsequently worked for Ocean Transport and Trading Ltd. He then joined the Conservative Research Department in 1976. He became a Conservative Party MP and Cabinet Secretary, winning the election for the first time in 1984 and entering the House of Commons.</p><p>In 1987, Portillo was assigned the role of Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Social Security, and then got promoted to Minister of State for Transport the next year. Surprisingly, in 1997, he was voted out of Parliament, which shocked many people as he had made tremendous progress and was expected to one day lead the Conservative Party.</p><p>From 1984 to 1997, he was a Conservative Party representative for Enfield Southgate and from 1999 to 2005 he was a representative for Kensington and Chelsea. After the 2005 general election, Michael chose to step away, but his and his wife’s political responsibilities remained.</p><p>The pair were seen together at events such as Margaret Thatcher’s funeral in 2013. Since retiring from his political duties, Michael has devoted himself to his media interests.</p><h2><strong>Is Michael Portillo Still Married To Carolyn Eadie?</strong></h2><p>Carolyn Eadie and her husband, Michael Portillo are still married and living together. Their marital union has lasted for almost four decades since they were married in 1982. They first came across each other at a high school party in the mid-70s and gradually developed a friendship which eventually led to them dating. On February 12, 1982, the two of them got hitched in a small but significant ceremony in London, with only their closest relatives present.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/heightline.com/wp-content/uploads/Carolyn-Eadie-1.jpg alt="Who Is Michael Portillo's Wife Carolyn Eadie?" width=696 height=464 sizes="(max-width: 696px) 100vw, 696px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Sadly, after two years of being married, Carolyn was diagnosed with breast cancer. This meant that she had to have a mastectomy and the couple’s plan to have kids were taken away from them. This must have been a devastating moment for the couple having to know that they cannot bear children of their own together.</p><p>Nevertheless, Carolyn and Michael’s love for each other remained true, and they have remained together since. We do not know if the couple decided to try alternative ways of having children, but there are no reports that suggest that – just as there are no reports that mention anyone as their child.</p><h3><strong>Carolyn Eadie Faced Criticisms From The Public Over Her Decision To Marry Michael Portillo</strong></h3><p>Carolyn Eadie and Michael Portillo’s marriage has had its fair share of controversies. One of the major reasons for that is her husband’s sexuality. As is the case with political officeholders whose pasts come to the fore when they vie for political positions, it was revealed that Michael was a gay man in his younger years.</p><p>When this fact was exposed, Carolyn was vilified for still marrying her husband despite knowing about his homosexual leanings before they got married. However, the businesswoman didn’t let the noise get to her because according to her, Michael Portillo confided in her about that part of his life and she felt it helped strengthen their relationship.</p><p>She believed that if Michael did not feel the need to hide something as important as that from her, it would be cruel to turn him down on the basis of his past.</p><h2><strong>Michael Portillo’s Wife Is A Businesswoman</strong></h2><p>Carolyn Eadie is one personality who loves to maintain a very private life away from the spotlight, which is also the reason why details on her career are very sketchy.</p><p>The celebrity wife is a British businesswoman and currently works as a Senior Executive Recruitment Consultant for Spencer Stuart in London. This company is in charge of locating senior officers to fill positions in companies such as the Barclays Chief Executive Position.</p><p>Carolyn Eadie has shown interest in politics. Most times she is seen talking about pressing political issues. She has equally been very supportive of her husband’s political career and they are frequently seen attending political events together.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZ60qcDLoqWeZpOkunDDx6hkoqtdoraktMCeo2aon6fBqrjLqKpmr5mbsm6vwKumpbGeYrKisMieZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jennifer-hudson-sex-and-the-city-3-might-be-happening-2014510.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jennifer Hudson Says Sex and the City 3 &amp;quot;Might Be Happening&amp;quot;">&larr;
